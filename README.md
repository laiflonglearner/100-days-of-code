# 100 Days of Code

I've decided to join the #100DaysOfCode challenge, a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. This repo is my log of progress, resources, and thoughts throughout the challenge.

## Why did I decide to join?

- I often lose my spark for coding, so I want to keep myself accountable and build a consistent coding habit.
- To build meaningful tools that I can use myself and share with others.
- To continuously grow my technical skills and explore areas outside my comfort zone.

## Rules

While this challenge has its own set of [rules](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/rules.md), here are mine to make sure I enjoy the process while staying committed:

1. Code for at least an hour a day.
2. Follow the two-day rule:
   - Don’t miss two days in a row.
   - Don’t miss more than two days in a week.
   - This will hopefully allow me to take breaks when needed without losing momentum :)
3. Courses and tutorials are fine if I'm not familiar with the topic and as long as I am actively coding along, but I will try to focus on building real projects to apply what I learn.
4. Log my progress in this repository and add a link to each day’s post in the log. This can be a link to a commit on GitHub or a blog post.
5. Share my progress on [Twitter](https://x.com/laiflonglearner/status/1939967625565438186) every day if possible, but batching updates is fine too so I can focus on learning instead of posting.

## 2\. Finalized List of Tools: What to Use and What to Skip ‚úÖ

We'll prioritize a **local VS Code-centric development workflow** to keep things simple and efficient for your solo project.

**Tools to Install/Use:**

- **SAP BTP Trial Account:** You already have this, and it's essential for deploying and running your application.
- **VS Code (Visual Studio Code):** Your primary IDE for all development tasks. It's lightweight, highly customizable, and well-supported for SAP development with extensions.
- **Node.js & npm:** Required for developing CAP applications. CAP leverages Node.js for its runtime.
- **Cloud Foundry CLI (cf CLI):** Absolutely necessary for deploying your application to the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment.
- **MTA Tools (optional, but recommended for deployment):** The Cloud Foundry CLI uses the Multi-Target Application (MTA) archive builder (`mbt`) to package your application for deployment. You can install it via `npm`.
- **VS Code Extensions for SAP Development:**
  - **SAP Fiori tools:** Provides guided development and wizards for creating Fiori Elements applications, simplifying UI development.
  - **CDS Language Support:** Offers syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and other helpful features for `.cds` files (CAP Data Models).
  - **SQLTools (and relevant driver like SQLite):** Useful for local database development with SQLite during the CAP development phase.

**Tools to Skip (and why):**

- **SAP Business Application Studio (BAS):** While BAS is a powerful cloud-based IDE for SAP development, it essentially provides a similar development experience to VS Code but in the cloud. For a solo project prioritizing local development and simplicity, **BAS is not required** and would introduce an unnecessary duplication of effort in learning a new environment. Sticking to local VS Code keeps your setup lean.
- **Eclipse:** Definitely skip Eclipse. It's primarily used for ABAP development or older Java-based SAP applications. It's not suitable for modern CAP and Fiori development on SAP BTP.

## 3\. Day-by-Day Plan (10 Days Max) üóìÔ∏è

This plan is structured to build your application incrementally, following SAP best practices while keeping it manageable within 10 days.

### Day 1: Setup and Project Initialization üöÄ

- **Install Node.js and npm:** Download and install the latest LTS version from the official Node.js website.
- **Install Cloud Foundry CLI:** Follow the instructions on the SAP BTP documentation to install the `cf CLI`.
- **Install MTA Tools:** `npm install -g mbt`
- **Install VS Code Extensions:** Open VS Code and install "SAP Fiori tools" and "CDS Language Support" from the Extensions Marketplace. Install "SQLTools" and its SQLite driver as well.
- **Initialize CAP Project:**
  - Create a new folder for your project (e.g., `inventory-app`).
  - Open VS Code in this folder.
  - Open the integrated terminal (Ctrl+\`).
  - Run `cds init` to initialize a new CAP project.

### Day 2: Define Data Model (CDS) üìä

- **Create Data Model:** In your CAP project, create a new file `db/schema.cds`.
- **Define Entities:** Define the `Materials` and `Stock` entities using CDS.

  ```cds
  // db/schema.cds
  namespace my.inventory;

  entity Materials : cuid {
      name        : String(100);
      description : String(255);
      unit        : String(10);
      stock       : Association to Stock;
  }

  entity Stock : cuid {
      material    : Association to Materials;
      quantity    : Integer;
      updatedAt   : Timestamp @cds.on.update;
  }
  ```

- **Run Local CAP Service:** `cds watch` in the terminal. This will automatically set up an in-memory SQLite database and expose your services locally.

### Day 3: Develop CAP Service (Backend Logic) ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Create Service Definition:** In your CAP project, create `srv/service.cds`.

  ```cds
  // srv/service.cds
  using { my.inventory as db } from '../db/schema';

  service InventoryService @(path : '/inventory') {
      entity Materials as projection on db.Materials;
      entity Stock     as projection on db.Stock;

      // Action for updating stock
      action updateStock(materialId: UUID, quantityChange: Integer);
  }
  ```

- **Implement Service Logic:** Create `srv/service.js` to implement the `updateStock` action.

  ```javascript
  // srv/service.js
  const cds = require("@sap/cds");

  module.exports = cds.service.impl(async function () {
    this.on("updateStock", async (req) => {
      const { materialId, quantityChange } = req.data;
      const tx = cds.transaction(req);

      const stockEntry = await tx.run(
        SELECT.one.from("my.inventory.Stock").where({ material_ID: materialId })
      );

      if (!stockEntry) {
        // Handle case where stock entry doesn't exist for material
        // For simplicity, let's create one if it doesn't exist
        await tx.run(
          INSERT.into("my.inventory.Stock").entries({
            material_ID: materialId,
            quantity: quantityChange, // Initial quantity
          })
        );
      } else {
        await tx.run(
          UPDATE("my.inventory.Stock")
            .set({ quantity: stockEntry.quantity + quantityChange })
            .where({ material_ID: materialId })
        );
      }
      return "Stock updated successfully!";
    });
  });
  ```

- **Test Service Locally:** Use a tool like Postman or a browser to test your CAP service endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:4004/inventory/Materials`).

### Day 4: Basic Fiori UI - Materials List Report üé®

- **Generate Fiori App:** In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Fiori: Open Application Generator".
- **Select Template:** Choose "List Report Page" as the template.
- **Data Source:** Connect to your CAP service. Select "Use a Local CAP Project" and point to your project root.
- **Service and Entity Selection:** Choose `InventoryService` and `Materials` as the main entity.
- **Basic Configuration:** Provide a module name (e.g., `materials-manage`) and title.
- **Run Fiori App Locally:** Your generated Fiori app will appear under the `app/` folder. Navigate into the app folder (e.g., `cd app/materials-manage`) and run `npm install` then `npm start` to see it.

### Day 5: Enhance Fiori UI - Stock Integration and Smartfield Annotations ‚ú®

- **Add Stock Information to Materials List:**

  - Open `app/materials-manage/webapp/annotations/annotations.cds`.
  - Add annotations to the `Materials` entity to display associated stock information, potentially as a column.
  - You might need to adjust the `ListReport` manifest settings in `manifest.json` to display these columns.
  <!-- end list -->

  ```cds
  // srv/service.cds (add an association to stock in Materials)
  entity Materials : cuid {
      name        : String(100);
      description : String(255);
      unit        : String(10);
      stock       : Association to Stock; // Ensure this is defined
  }

  // srv/service.js (ensure stock is expanded or available)
  // You may need to adjust your CAP service to include stock data for Materials
  // For example, using @(restrict) or @(cds.autoexpose) on the association.

  // app/materials-manage/webapp/annotations/annotations.cds (Example - adjust for your specific needs)
  annotate InventoryService.Materials with {
      name @(UI.LineItem: [{Value: name}]);
      description @(UI.LineItem: [{Value: description}]);
      unit @(UI.LineItem: [{Value: unit}]);
      stock.quantity @(UI.LineItem: [{Value: stock.quantity, Label: 'Current Stock'}]);
  }
  ```

- **Implement Stock Update Action (Basic):** For simplicity, you can initially add a custom action button on the list report or object page that triggers a predefined stock update (e.g., "Add 10 to Stock"). You'll connect this to your `updateStock` CAP action. This will involve modifying the `manifest.json` and adding some custom controller logic.

### Day 6: Connect Fiori App to CAP Service (Deployment Preparation) üîó

- **Review `package.json` and `mta.yaml`:**
  - `package.json` in your CAP project will have scripts for building and deploying.
  - The `mta.yaml` file is crucial for defining your multi-target application (MTA) for deployment to BTP. CAP generates a basic `mta.yaml`. Review it to ensure it includes your `db` module (for HANA deployment) and `srv` module (for CAP service deployment).
- **Configure HANA Service (Trial Account):**
  - In your SAP BTP Trial account, navigate to your Cloud Foundry space.
  - Create an **SAP HANA Cloud instance** (free tier). This will be your persistent database.
  - Create a **service instance** for the HANA database (e.g., `my-hana-db`) in your Cloud Foundry space.
  - Create a **service key** for this HANA service instance.
- **Update `package.json` for HANA deployment:** Modify the `cds build --production` command or add `requires` entries in `mta.yaml` to bind your CAP service to the HANA database.

### Day 7: Deployment to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry ‚òÅÔ∏è

- **Build MTA Archive:** In your project root, run `mbt build`. This will create an `mta_archives` folder with a `.mtar` file.
- **Login to Cloud Foundry:** Open your terminal and run `cf login -a <API endpoint> -o <org> -s <space>`. You'll find these details in your SAP BTP Trial account.
- **Deploy Application:** Run `cf deploy mta_archives/<your-app-name>.mtar`. This will deploy your database, CAP service, and Fiori UI to your BTP Trial account.
- **Troubleshooting:** Monitor the deployment logs carefully. Common issues include missing service instances, incorrect configurations in `mta.yaml`, or build errors.

### Day 8: Test and Refine Deployed App üß™

- **Access Deployed App:** Once deployed, you'll get a URL for your Fiori app. Open it in your browser.
- **Test Functionality:**
  - Create new materials.
  - View materials and their stock.
  - Attempt to update stock (ensure your `updateStock` action works end-to-end).
- **Troubleshoot (if needed):** Use the Cloud Foundry CLI (`cf logs <app-name> --recent`) to check logs for your CAP service and Fiori app if you encounter issues. Use the SAP BTP cockpit to verify service bindings and application health.

### Day 9: Implement Stock Update UI (Dialog or Object Page) üîÑ

- **Enhanced Stock Update:** Instead of a simple button, create a more robust UI for stock updates.
  - **Option 1: Pop-up Dialog:** When a user selects a material and clicks "Update Stock," a dialog appears where they can enter the quantity change (positive for goods receipt, negative for goods issue).
  - **Option 2: Object Page Extension:** Navigate to an object page for a specific material and have the stock update functionality directly on that page.
- **Fiori tools for Custom Action:** Use SAP Fiori tools to add custom actions and corresponding dialogs or navigation to your Fiori Elements app. This involves extending the generated Fiori application.

### Day 10: Final Touches and Portfolio Readiness üåü

- **Basic Styling/Branding (Optional):** If time permits, you can apply some minimal theming or adjust manifest settings for a more polished look.
- **README.md:** Create a comprehensive `README.md` file in your GitHub repository.
  - **Project Description:** What the app does.
  - **Features:** List the implemented features.
  - **Tech Stack:** SAP CAP, Fiori Elements, Node.js, Cloud Foundry.
  - **Setup Instructions:** How to set up and run the app locally and how to deploy it (referencing your BTP trial account).
  - **Screenshots/Demo:** Include screenshots or a short GIF/video of the app in action.
- **GitHub Repository:** Push your code to a public GitHub repository. This is crucial for your portfolio\!

## 4\. Setup Notes and Integration Flow üìù

The integration flow largely follows the **CAP full-stack approach**, where CAP acts as the bridge between your database and the Fiori frontend.

- **Local Development with VS Code:**
  - You'll be using the **VS Code terminal** for all `cds` commands (e.g., `cds init`, `cds watch`), `npm` commands (e.g., `npm install`, `npm start`), and `cf CLI` commands (e.g., `cf login`, `cf deploy`).
  - The **SAP Fiori tools VS Code extension** will guide you through generating the Fiori UI and adding extensions, but the actual development will be in the VS Code editor.
  - During `cds watch`, CAP provides an **in-memory SQLite database** by default, which is perfect for rapid local backend development and testing without needing a persistent database.
- **CAP + Fiori Integration:**
  - Your **CAP service** (defined in `srv/service.cds` and implemented in `srv/service.js`) exposes the OData V4 service that your Fiori app consumes.
  - **Fiori Elements** (generated by Fiori tools) automatically builds the UI based on the metadata exposed by your CAP service. This includes the entities, properties, and annotations you define in CDS.
  - When you run `npm start` in your Fiori app's directory, it will proxy requests to your locally running CAP service (if `cds watch` is active).
- **Deployment to BTP Cloud Foundry:**
  - The `mta.yaml` file is the blueprint for your deployment. It defines the different **modules** of your application:
    - `db` module: Responsible for deploying your CDS data model to the SAP HANA Cloud instance.
    - `srv` module: Deploys your CAP service (Node.js application) as a Cloud Foundry application.
    - `app` module: Deploys your Fiori UI (static content) as a Cloud Foundry HTML5 application.
  - The `cf deploy` command reads this `mta.yaml` and orchestrates the creation of necessary services, application deployments, and bindings in your Cloud Foundry space.

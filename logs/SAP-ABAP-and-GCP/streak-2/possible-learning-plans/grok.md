- **Tools**: Visual Studio 2022, SAP GUI, Postman (for RFC testing), Git for version control.

## Project Scope

- **Core Features**:
  - Add, update, and delete inventory items.
  - View and track stock levels.
  - Generate a simple stock report (e.g., list items with low stock).
  - Basic user authentication for secure access.
- **Constraints**:
  - 10-day deadline.
  - Focus on simplicity and polish for job application purposes.
  - Use standard SAP BAPIs to minimize custom ABAP code.
  - Clean, responsive UI using Bootstrap.

# Inventory Management Project Plan for Job Application

## Objective

Develop a concise inventory management system using SAP (MM module) and a C# ASP.NET Core front-end to demonstrate SAP integration, programming skills, and efficient development for a job application, within 10 days.

- Estimated time: 6 hours.

## To-Do List

### Day 1-2: Setup and Requirements

- [ ] Install SAP .NET Connector (NCo 3.1) in Visual Studio 2022.
- [ ] Verify SAP system access (SAP ERP or S/4HANA with MM module).
- [ ] Define inventory data model:
  - Fields: Material ID, Name, Quantity, Unit Price, Storage Location.
- [ ] Create ASP.NET Core MVC project in Visual Studio (use .NET 8.0).
- [ ] Install NuGet packages:
  - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc
  - SAP.Middleware.Connector
- [ ] Set up a local SQL Server database for user authentication (optional).
- [ ] Initialize Git repository for version control.
- [ ] Draft API requirements (e.g., AddItem, UpdateStock, GetStock).

### Day 3-4: SAP Backend Configuration

- [ ] Configure SAP MM module:
  - Set up material master data for inventory items.
- [ ] Use standard BAPIs for:
  - [ ] Adding items (BAPI_MATERIAL_SAVEDATA).
  - [ ] Updating stock (BAPI_GOODSMVT_CREATE).
  - [ ] Retrieving stock data (BAPI_MATERIAL_GETLIST, BAPI_MATERIAL_STOCK).
- [ ] Test BAPIs in SAP GUI (transaction SE37).
- [ ] Enable RFC for BAPIs to allow external calls.
- [ ] Validate BAPI responses using Postman for RFC simulation.
- [ ] Handle basic error cases (e.g., invalid material ID).

### Day 5-7: Front-End Development

- [ ] Create ASP.NET Core controllers:
  - [ ] InventoryController (add, update, delete, list items).
  - [ ] ReportController (display stock levels, low stock alerts).
  - [ ] AuthController (login/logout).
- [ ] Integrate SAP .NET Connector in C# to call BAPIs.
- [ ] Create Razor views:
  - [ ] Item list (table with search/filter by Material ID or Name).
  - [ ] Item add/edit form.
  - [ ] Stock report page (list items with Quantity < 10).
- [ ] Add Bootstrap 5 for responsive, professional UI.
- [ ] Implement simple authentication (e.g., ASP.NET Identity or custom login with SQL Server).
- [ ] Test SAP integration (ensure BAPI calls return correct data).

### Day 8-9: Testing and Polish

- [ ] Write unit tests for C# controllers (use xUnit or MSTest).
- [ ] Test SAP BAPI calls for edge cases (e.g., empty stock, duplicate IDs).
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing:
  - Add item, update stock, view report, login/logout.
- [ ] Optimize UI (e.g., add sorting to item list, improve form validation).
- [ ] Fix bugs and ensure error messages are user-friendly.
- [ ] Clean code (remove unused code, add comments).

### Day 10: Documentation and Packaging

- [ ] Deploy app to local IIS or Azure App Service for demo.
- [ ] Verify SAP RFC connection in deployed environment.
- [ ] Write project documentation:
  - Overview of features and tech stack.
  - SAP BAPI usage and C# integration details.
  - Setup instructions (e.g., SAP NCo, ASP.NET Core).
- [ ] Create a user guide (1-2 pages):
  - How to add/update items, view reports, and log in.
- [ ] Package project:
  - Zip source code (C# and any ABAP code).
  - Include README with setup and demo instructions.
- [ ] Prepare a brief presentation (2-3 slides) summarizing the project for job application.

## Notes

- **Efficiency Tips**:
  - Use standard BAPIs to avoid custom ABAP, showcasing SAP expertise.
  - Keep UI minimal but polished (focus on functionality over aesthetics).
  - Use async/await in C# for SAP RFC calls to demonstrate modern coding practices.
- **Showcase for Job Application**:
  - Highlight SAP integration (BAPI usage, RFC calls).
  - Emphasize clean C# code and ASP.NET Core MVC structure.
  - Include error handling and basic security (authentication).
- **Risks**:
  - SAP access issues: Confirm credentials and RFC permissions early.
  - Time constraints: Focus on core features; defer extras like advanced filters.
- **Dependencies**:
  - SAP system with MM module access.
  - Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 8.0 SDK.
  - SAP .NET Connector license (free for development).

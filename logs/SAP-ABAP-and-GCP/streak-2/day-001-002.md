# Day 1: Setup Development Environment

## Objective

Set up the development environment for the SAP CAP-based inventory management app, initialize the project structure, and verify connectivity to SAP BTP Trial.

## Tasks

1. ✅ **Verify Node.js Installation**:

   - ~~Ensure Node.js (LTS version, e.g., 18.x) and npm are installed.~~
   - ~~Run in terminal: `node -v` and `npm -v` to confirm versions.~~
   - ~~If not installed, download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).~~

2. ✅ **Install SAP CDS Development Kit**:

   - ~~Install globally: `npm install -g @sap/cds-dk`.~~
   - ~~Verify installation: `cds -v`.~~

3. ✅ **Install Cloud Foundry CLI**:

   - ~~Follow SAP’s guide: [Install cf CLI](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html).~~
   - ~~Verify installation: `cf -v`.~~

4. ✅ **Install Multi-Target Application (MTA) Build Tool**:

   - ~~Install globally: `npm install -g mbt`.~~
   - ~~Verify installation: `mbt -v`.~~
   - **Why**: Required for building the MTA archive for Cloud Foundry deployment.

5. ✅ **Install VS Code Extensions**:

   - ~~Open VS Code, go to Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl+Shift+X).~~
   - ~~Install:~~
     - ~~**SAP CDS Language Support**: For CDS file editing and autocompletion.~~
     - ~~**SAP Fiori Tools Extension Pack**: For generating Fiori Elements UI.~~
     - ~~**SQLTools** with **SQLTools SQLite Driver**: For local SQLite database management.~~
   - **Why**: These extensions enable CAP development and Fiori UI generation in VS Code.

6. ✅ **Log in to SAP BTP Trial**:

   - ~~Run: `cf login`.~~
   - ~~Use your SAP BTP Trial credentials and select the Cloud Foundry organization/space.~~
   - **Why**: Verifies connectivity to BTP for later deployment.

7. ✅ **Initialize CAP Project**:
   - ~~Create a project folder: `mkdir inventory-app && cd inventory-app`.~~
   - ~~Open folder in VS Code: `code .`.~~
   - ~~Run `npm install` to install dependencies.~~
   - **Why**: Creates the project structure (`db/`, `srv/`, `app/`) with sample files to simplify setup.

## Tools

- **VS Code**: Primary IDE for all tasks.
- **Node.js/npm**: CAP runtime and dependency management.
- **Cloud Foundry CLI (cf CLI)**: For BTP connectivity.
- **MTA Build Tool (mbt)**: For building deployment artifacts.
- **SAP BTP Trial**: Cloud environment for deployment.

## Deliverable

- Project folder (`inventory-app`) with CAP structure (`db/`, `srv/`, `app/`).
- Verified environment setup with all tools installed and BTP Trial connectivity confirmed.

## Notes

- **Why mbt**: Included from the second plan as it’s necessary for MTA-based deployments to BTP Cloud Foundry, complementing cf CLI.
- **Why SQLTools**: Enhances SQLite database management in VS Code, useful for local testing.
- **Why --add sample**: Provides sample CDS files to accelerate development, as per the first plan.
- **No BAS**: VS Code is sufficient, avoiding redundant cloud IDE setup per your preference.

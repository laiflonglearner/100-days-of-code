### Day 007 - 2025/08/01

- Tried some debugging but it didn't work. So the issue is: Fiori UI fails to display the material list when using `npm start` (which runs `cds-serve`), despite data being accessible via `http://localhost:4004/inventory/Materials` when using `cds watch`.
- Why did this happen? o_O So the problem emerged after I attempted to switch from SQLite to MySQL, followed by a git revert to restore the original SQLite setup. I thought SQLite wasn't the best practice for production and that itâ€™d be better to use standard MySQL. It turns out SAP is compatible with SQLite by default, which means switching to MySQL requires me to change many underlying structures. Well, it's technically possible but I have a skill issue for sure ðŸ˜‚
- The OData endpoint still returns data with `cds watch`, but `npm start` encounters a `no such table: InventoryService_Materials` error a.k.a. it fails to load data, which means Fiori UI fails to render the list. Three new files (seem to be empty databases) also appeared after the revert, and the database configuration history is unclear sadge (>\_<)

### 2025/08/02: Break

I took a break from coding today. [Here's the detailed update of what I did](https://x.com/laiflonglearner/status/1951636648510566702). I tried to code when I got back home but I was too exhausted. Technically Iâ€™ve already taken more than two days off this week (which means I _should_ reset my coding streak), but what I did today was really important for my studies so yes Iâ€™m letting the streak continue.
Iâ€™ll try my best to get back on track tomorrow.

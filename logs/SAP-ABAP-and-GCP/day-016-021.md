## Day 016 – 021: 2025/07/16 to 2025/07/21

Day 016

- Learned about SAP & ABAP foundations. I was expecting some coding, but so far there wasn’t any. It's more about understanding the concepts and how to navigate the SAP system.
- Joined Google Cloud Arcade 2025. I’m mainly seeking the community aspect tbh since I’ve tried GCP before. Still waiting for the confirmation email, so I just explored the website, the gamification looks pretty interesting :D

Day 017

- I didn't get a chance to code, I spent literally the whole day working on tasks and a mini project for another program I joined (Link Women 2025 - LinkedIn x UN Women).
- Also got my confirmation email for Google Cloud Arcade, so I redeemed my code and set up the learning path I plan to follow.

Day 018

- I tried to start coding using SAP, already installed Eclipse and ADT, but I couldn't create a free trial BTP acc. I got stuck on the verification step for an hour which the issue was absolutely on their end. I finally decided to email support and they fixed it by letting me to skip that step so I didn't have to verify again. But I got stuck again on the ToS page, which was also another issue on their end :) I clicked the daym checklist button to agree but it led me to a plain white page no UI no nothing just "HTTP Status 400". I asked Gemini and she said it's such a common issue, and I was like really? o_O okay, so the solution was to delete the cache and everything else, which reset ALL my passwords and accounts including email etc, literally everything in the browser. I had to do that and it wasn't fun at all. I need to be more patient but that was the line, I decided to switch to Arcade instead :)
- Tried to do the 1st week Trivia. There are 4 labs. The first lab was about NLP and it was straightforward. The second lab was about Document AI Processor, which should be easy, but I got stuck on this error. It's 10:04pm now and I'm too eepy to continue. I'll try again tomorrow InshaAllah. ![alt text](day-018-error.png)

Day 019: I solved the error, but I didn't code an hour in total

Day 020: -

**Progress Summary:**

**I didn't code for two days straight (Day 016-017), which is something that I want to allow myself because I didn't do it intentionally, but even days afterward I feel that I didn't do well this week, so I want to restart my streak. Why did this happen?**

- I was busy with other programs and tasks. At this point, I feel like I'm trying to juggle too many things at once. The Link Women program I joined also took a significant portion of my time. But I don't want to make any excuses, I'll discuss more in the next point.

- For SAP, I didn't have a clear learning path. I did well for the first 15 days (learning JS) because I enrolled in a good course: the material, code challenges, final assessment, and the community were all there. There's no SAP tutorial out there that satisfies what I'm looking for including YouTube. Udemy has SAP-related courses but they're mostly for non-developer roles. There are 86 courses in [SAP Learning](https://learning.sap.com/courses?page=1&roles=data_analyst&roles=data_scientist&roles=developer) related to coding and data, which I later filtered to 10-15 courses. But each course can take hours to finish, I tried the first two courses, but they mostly teach us how the platform works rather than how to code _something_ within the platform. I have something in mind to tackle this, let's see if it works or not.

- For Google Cloud Arcade, we actually have a clear learning path laid out. The problem is I approached this challenge the wrong way, so I didn't feel like I learned something significant last week. There's almost no incentive from their end to make sure we grasp the entire concept or understand why a step is so essential for doing the next one, etc. The labs are designed for us to pass the assessments, which can be done by just copy-pasting the commands provided into Cloud Shell or SSH in browser, or by looking for others' solutions on YouTube if we find an error since this challenge is held globally. Soooo eventually relying on the learning path alone is actually enough to secure points and win the challenge. But it's not enough to actually learn about cloud and its infrastructure, so the knowledge and skills acquired can be applied in Azure, AWS, Oracle, and other cloud platforms..., I also have something in mind to do this, let's seeeeeeee.

**Time spent:** I didn't count it precisely tbh, but probably \~10 hours

**Up Next:** Restart the challenge, come up with a personalized learning plan, and stick to it (+ adjust if needed)!

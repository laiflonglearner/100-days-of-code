## Day 016 – 021: 2025/07/16 to 2025/07/21

Day 016

- Learned about SAP & ABAP foundations. I was expecting some coding, but so far there wasn’t any. It's more about understanding the concepts and how to navigate the SAP system.
- Joined Google Cloud Arcade 2025. I’m mainly seeking the community aspect tbh since I’ve tried GCP before. Still waiting for the confirmation email, so I just explored the website, the gamification looks pretty interesting :D

Day 017

- I didn't get a chance to code, I spent literally the whole day working on tasks and a mini project for another program I joined (Link Women 2025 - LinkedIn x UN Women).
- Also got my confirmation email for Google Cloud Arcade, so I redeemed my code and set up the learning path I plan to follow.

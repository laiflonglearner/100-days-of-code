## Day 002 – 007: 2025/07/02 to 2025/07/07

**Progress Summary:**

- Continued my JS course.
- Learned and practiced:
  - **Modularization:** import/export, named imports, and module structure (CommonJS & ES Modules).
  - **Object-Oriented Programming:** classes, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and object composition.
  - **Functional Programming:** higher-order, pure, and recursive functions, and immutability.
  - **Asynchronous Programming:** callbacks, Promises, async/await.
- Completed coding quizzes and practice exercises for each topic.
- Took breaks on **July 3** and **July 6**, but still followed the two-day rule (no two skipped days in a row, no more than two missed in a week).

**Time spent:** \~7 hours total across 5 active days.

**Thoughts:**
The pace wasn’t too intense, but I finally feel like I’m building some consistency and getting a grip on JS basics. I’m still at the stage where I write code just to pass the quizzes and ngl I feel a bit clueless about how to apply these concepts in real projects. But I know it’s part of the process hehe :)
Looking forward to finishing this course so I can move on to the next one where I’ll finally build a small backend JS project yayy

**Up Next:**

- Finish the last module in this course (code quality!) and wrap it up.
- Move on to the next course (JS backend & APIs)

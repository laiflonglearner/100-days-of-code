Day 016

- Learned about SAP & ABAP foundations. I was expecting some coding, but so far there wasn’t any. It's more about understanding the concepts and how to navigate the SAP system.
- Joined Google Cloud Arcade 2025. I’m mainly seeking the community aspect tbh since I’ve tried GCP before. Still waiting for the confirmation email, so I just explored the website, the gamification looks pretty interesting :D

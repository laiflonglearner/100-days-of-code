## Day 008 â€“ 014: 2025/07/08 to 2025/07/14

**Progress Summary:**

- Finished JS course.
- Learned and practiced about code quality:
  - Flow Type Checker
  - ESLint
  - Typescript basic
  - Testing with Node.js
  - Testing with Bun
- Submitted final assesment
- Took breaks on **July 8** and **July 14**, but still followed the two-day rule (no two skipped days in a row, no more than two missed in a week).

**Time spent:** \~12 hours total across 5 days.

**Thoughts:**
I expected myself to have 7 days streak, but I took breaks for two days. The testing part was fun, it challenged me to how to break down problems and think about edge cases, but because in this course it was only to test simple calculation functions, I feel like I haven't fully grasped the testing concepts yet. I assume you need other users to test your code in real-world scenarios, in this course I use AI to test my code, which is not the same as real-world testing but I learned that some cases that might be trivial and so obvious actualy can be missed if you don't think about it carefully.

**Up Next:**

- Move on to the next course (JS backend & APIs)
- Build a simple inventory management project

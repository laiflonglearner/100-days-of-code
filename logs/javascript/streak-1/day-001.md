# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 001: 2025-07-01

**Today's Progress:**

- Started the course **"Belajar Dasar Pemrograman JavaScript"** by Dicoding
- Completed 4 quizzes covering:
  - Variables and Data Types
  - Functions and Loops
  - Conditional Statements and Flow Control
  - Error Handling

**Time spent**: 1 hour 7 minutes

**Thoughts:**
The concepts weren’t new, but it felt good to go back to the basics. It’s also interesting to see how JavaScript shares some structural similarities with Java esp in syntax flow and logic structure
